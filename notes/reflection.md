# Reflection

This phase reinforced the importance of building a solid Layer 2
foundation before introducing routing complexity.

Troubleshooting interface state issues in GNS3 improved my understanding
of how physical connectivity affects logical configuration. I also gained
confidence reading Linux networking output and identifying which problems
belong to the OS, the hypervisor, or the network design itself.

Designing the network before configuring it made implementation smoother
and reduced guesswork.
