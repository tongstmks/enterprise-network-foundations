# Enterprise Network Foundations

## Project Goal

Design and deploy a segmented internal enterprise network with scalable IP addressing and dynamic routing.

## Scenario

You are a junior network engineer tasked with designing a small enterprise internal network for a growing company.

### Business Requirements

- 3 departments
- Network segmentation
- Future growth planning
- Remote workers (VPN consideration)
- Potential expansion into 2–5 cities
- No Internet connectivity (internal-only network)

### Responsibilities

- IP addressing design
- Routing protocol selection
- Logical segmentation
- Technical documentation

## Architecture Decisions

This project focuses on _design-first networking_, where decisions are documented before implementation.

Key design areas:

- Departmental segmentation
- Scalable IP addressing
- Dynamic routing
